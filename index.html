          I am learning here to change my life. Friends describe me as calm
          person.<br />
          Indeed i don't like to argue if not necessary. I prefer to find
          compromise for situation<br />
          so it will be comfortable with all.
        </p>
        <p>For now i am working at local airport as agent.</p>
        <p>
          I am new. So i don't know much.<br />
          And can't provide any type of "code example" of mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          I studied at Saint-Petesburg Polytechnical University for 4 years.<br />
          Then i had to quit because of lack of money and time.
        </p>
        <p>I belive my english skill is B1 (intermidiate).</p>
        <p>
          UPD: Completed suggested
          <a href="https://www.efset.org/ru/free-english-test/">test</a> (quick
          check). It says that my english skill is<br />
          somewhere between C1 Advanced and C2 Proficient.<br />
          Second (50 minutes) test says
          <a href="https://www.efset.org/cert/t9cX2a">this</a>.
